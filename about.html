        <h2>About Jenna's Journals of Style</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Jenna's Journals of Style - where the thrill of the catwalk meets the everyday charm of the sidewalk. Through this vibrant diary of design, I invite you to embark on a journey interwoven with tales of creativity, innovation, and heartfelt narratives.

            My fascination with the world of tech began during my Computer Science days at MSU, a phase that swiftly paved the way to a deep passion for Information Science. The allure of UX design soon beckoned, and I found myself engrossed in the art of storyboarding and the intricate details of usability testing. My dedication to design didn't stop there; I proudly serve on the UX design team for MSU's iconic fashion magazine, VIM.
            
            Summer days were spent diving into Google's UX Design courses, familiarizing myself with tools like Figma, and basking in the knowledge of prototyping. Yet, amidst all the tech enthusiasm, one constant remained: my love for design. This passion saw me becoming the secretary of AIGA, MSU's premier design club, and crafting websites and gripping social media content. But what truly fuels my spirit is my personal hobby - digital photography. Capturing moments, emotions, and stories through the lens is an experience unlike any other.
